<div style="height: 300px; background-color: green;">
    <p>The static state of parent1 sets the 3D transform and perspective states, starting at 0px height. The static state of parent3 sets the transition and transformation of the rotation. Upon hover the parent1 and parent3 heights are animated to full height, 111px in this case, and rotated to 0deg, i.e. a front-facing state.</p>
